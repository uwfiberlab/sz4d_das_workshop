# SZ4D Open DAS Data for Subduction Zone Environments

## Overview
This half-day mini-workshop aims to introduce participants to publicly available DAS datasets and open-source tools, demonstrate analysis techniques relevant to subduction zone science, foster collaboration and data sharing to enhance reproducibility within the SZ4D community, and build connections among early-career and established researchers.

The event will take place at the Tulane River & Coastal Center, located one block south of the Convention Center ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?mid=1UC7Jxo5ibAlLGRE-w5grOP8jwSccRHc&usp=sharing))
